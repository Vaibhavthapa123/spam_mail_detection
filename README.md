Email spam remains a pervasive issue in today's digital world, leading to wasted time, resource drain, and potential security threats. This project aims to tackle the problem of email spam by developing a logistic regression model for effective classification. The project utilizes the TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction and logistic regression for classification.
The project commences with the acquisition of a dataset consisting of email messages categorized as spam or ham (non-spam). Data preprocessing techniques are employed to handle missing values, while categorical variables are encoded for further analysis. The TfidfVectorizer is then applied to convert the textual content of the emails into numerical features, using the concept of TF-IDF to capture the significance of words in the messages.
Following the feature extraction phase, the dataset is divided into training and test sets. The logistic regression model is trained on the training set, leveraging the extracted features. During the training process, the model learns to distinguish between spam and ham emails based on the provided features.
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, on both the training and test datasets. This evaluation provides insights into the model's ability to generalize and make accurate predictions on unseen data. Additionally, a thorough analysis of the confusion matrix and classification report helps in understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses.
The trained logistic regression model is then deployed to classify new email messages as spam or ham. By leveraging the TfidfVectorizer, the incoming email messages are transformed into numerical features, allowing the model to make predictions based on the learned patterns from the training phase.
The results of this project demonstrate that the logistic regression model, coupled with the TfidfVectorizer, can effectively classify email messages as spam or ham. The achieved accuracy and performance metrics validate the model's capability to distinguish between the two categories. Furthermore, the interpretability of the logistic regression model provides insights into the significant features driving the classification decisions.
In conclusion, this project showcases the successful implementation of logistic regression and the TfidfVectorizer for email spam classification. The developed model serves as a valuable tool in combating the menace of email spam, enabling users and organizations to filter out unwanted and potentially harmful messages effectively.
